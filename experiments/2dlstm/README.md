# 2d lstm pytorch

2d lstm implementation for pytorch

Multidimentional recurrent neural networks   
are introduced in Alex Graves thesis "Supervised Sequence Labeling with Recurrent Neural Networks".

See chapter 8 Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks.

For usage see mnist example in test.py
