## Invariances and Generalization 

Several experiments which study ability of different networks to
generalize shift and rotation

* [baseline](baseline)  - simple cnn architectures 
* [caps_net](caps_net)  - "classical" capsule networks
* [gencaps_net](gencaps_net)  - different types of generative capsules 
* [hypernets](hypernets)  - second order HyperNets
